The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` within a `width` property inside a flex container might not work as expected if the flex container's width isn't explicitly defined.  This is because `calc()` needs a defined parent element to calculate properly. Another issue might be caused by incorrect operator precedence in nested `calc()` functions.
