# Unexpected Behavior with CSS `calc()` Function

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, issue related to the `calc()` function in CSS. Specifically, we'll explore unexpected behavior when using `calc()` to determine the width of elements within flexbox containers.

## The Problem

The `calc()` function in CSS is incredibly useful, enabling dynamic calculations of lengths. However, using `calc()` inside a flexbox layout often produces unexpected behavior, particularly when the flex container's width isn't explicitly set.  Nested `calc()` may also introduce precedence errors that are hard to debug.

## Reproduction

The `bug.css` file contains CSS that causes the problem. Observe how the width is calculated relative to its parent. 

## Solution

The solution is to ensure that the flex container has an explicitly defined width, resolving calculation ambiguity for `calc()`.   Alternatively, avoid using `calc()` for width calculation relative to parent if the parent width is dynamic or not explicitly set.  For nested `calc()`, use parentheses to ensure the intended order of operations.

The `bugSolution.css` file demonstrates the corrected CSS with appropriate fixes.
